# Welcome to My-Name
This is a Project I created for anyone just starting out in CSS and Open-Source. The Project as of now contains an example div, you can add a similar section with your name and something about yourself, or you could go all the way out and add something extra you'd want too. Consider this as a learning exercise and your initial step into the world of contribution and Open-Source. If you like the idea of this project make sure to share it with your friends. You can see what the Web Page currently looks like, [Here](https://vansh-goel.github.io/My-Name/)

## How to get Started
- I would like to suggest you to get some hands-on experience with HTML and Basic CSS first on your local machine
- After making sure you're comfortable start by editing the HTML and CSS files given in the repository 
- Along with the changes made to the code, add your name in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file
- This is a learning experience so don't worry too much about it, just get started and let's all build this WebPage together
- Happy Contributing!!

**Yes This Project was Inspired from Shawshank Redemption's "Brooks Was Here"**
